Collection of Scripts and Stuff I use with my Pi

##VNC - Finder_Pi##

If you are a Mac user then you will probably be used to seeing other Macs in the network automatically show up in the Finder, so that you can log on to
them and browse the file system or even remote control them.
The Finder_Pi code will do that for the Pi

##VNC - Autostart##
Use this command to create the required file:
```sudo chmod 755 /etc/init.d/tightvncserver```

Then copy the contents of the tightvncserver
